career-profile:
    title: About
    summary: |
      I'm passionate about transmitting knowledge through teaching and mentoring.
      As an Engineer I love to create tools that significantly improve peoples’ lives.
      As a Software Engineer I'm passionate about applications for team collaboration and organizational communication, keeping in mind that every technical innovation needs to account for human interaction and collaboration.
      In my PhD I dug deep into Model Based System Engineering focusing on processes and  tools for concurrent conceptual design of complex systems.      

      In my spare time I engage in promoting a culture of dialogue and universal fraternity.
